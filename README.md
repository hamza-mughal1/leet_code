# leet_code

created on 19-9-2023

the purpose of creating this repo is to save my code somewhere online and also to start using github "because why not".

if you are a programmer and not using github it's so boring because using a github is like a social status type thing, it makes you feel proud in public
and let you feel more senior. 

NGL it kinda feels more badas$$ using github and github-desktop in front of a "NON-PROGRAMMING" guy.
